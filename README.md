<h1 align="center">Drawgo</h1>

<p align="center">
  A self-hosted whiteboard built with <strong>Draw</strong> (Excalidraw) + <strong>Go</strong> — hence the name.
</p>

---

> **You probably don't need this. Use [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) instead.**
>
> [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) is the best whiteboard tool available — free, open-source, beautifully designed, end-to-end encrypted, and actively maintained by a world-class team. **For nearly all use cases, the official Excalidraw is the right choice.**
>
> Drawgo is **not** a replacement. It wraps the open-source Excalidraw editor inside an opinionated, self-hosted stack for a narrow set of requirements the official product intentionally doesn't cover:
>
> - **Multi-tenant workspaces** with role-based access (Owner / Admin / Member / Viewer)
> - **Persistent version history** with point-in-time restore
> - **Audit logging** for compliance (who did what, when, from where)
> - **Full data sovereignty** — PostgreSQL + MinIO, everything on your infrastructure
> - **Share links** with granular permissions and expiry
> - **Real-time collaboration** with WebSocket cursors and presence
> - **Automated backups** with Grandfather-Father-Son retention
> - **Markdown & rich text cards** on the canvas (Mermaid diagrams, Tiptap WYSIWYG)
>
> If you don't need these specific features, **use [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)** — it's simpler, faster, more polished, and requires zero infrastructure.
>
> **Huge respect to the Excalidraw team** for building and open-sourcing such an extraordinary tool. Drawgo exists only because of their work.

- Image Support — upload images to S3 (SHA256 dedup, MIME validation)
- Full-Text Search — find boards by title, description, or content
- Smart Autosave — ETag-based optimistic concurrency, saves only on changes

### Collaboration
- Share Links — create viewer/editor links with optional expiry
- Live Cursors — smooth 30fps cursor positions via WebSocket with native Excalidraw rendering

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/darwinbatres/drawgo.git
cd drawgo
cp .env.example .env

# Generate secrets (REQUIRED)
sed -i "s/CHANGE_ME_RUN_openssl_rand_hex_32/$(openssl rand -hex 32)/" .env
sed -i "s/CHANGE_ME_USE_STRONG_PASSWORD/$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n')/" .env

# Start everything
docker compose up -d --build

# Open http://localhost:3021
```

### What's Running

| Service      | Port  | Description                  |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| **Caddy**    | 3021  | Reverse proxy (entry point)  |
| **Backend**  | 8090  | Go API + WebSocket (debug)   |
| **Postgres** | 5433  | PostgreSQL 16 (localhost)    |
| **MinIO**    | 9010  | S3 API (localhost)           |
| **MinIO UI** | 9011  | MinIO console (localhost)    |

All ports are configurable via `.env`. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for production setup.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+** — Backend
- **Node.js 22+** / **pnpm 10+** — Frontend
- **Docker & Docker Compose** — PostgreSQL + MinIO

### Backend (Go)

```bash
cd backend

# Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d postgres minio

# Run with live reload (install air: go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest)
air
# Or run directly
go run ./cmd/server

# Run tests (requires Docker for testcontainers)
go test ./... -count=1
```

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for Go-specific details.

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 (dev) or http://localhost:3021 (via Docker/Caddy)
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start Next.js dev server (Turbopack)
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript strict type check
pnpm docker:build     # Build all Docker images
pnpm docker:up        # Start Docker Compose stack
pnpm docker:down      # Stop Docker Compose stack
pnpm docker:logs      # Follow frontend container logs
```

## Configuration

**All configuration lives in `.env.example`.** Copy it to `.env` and customize:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The file is fully documented with sections for every service (ports, database, JWT, OAuth, S3, CORS, logging, WebSocket, rate limiting, brute-force, body limits, backups, frontend, resource limits, Cloudflare Tunnel).

### Key Variables

| Variable              | Required | Default            | Description                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET`          | **Yes**  | —                  | JWT signing key (min 32 chars)    |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`   | **Yes**  | —                  | Database password                 |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY`       | No       | `minioadmin`       | MinIO access key                  |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY`       | No       | `minioadmin`       | MinIO secret key                  |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`| No       | `localhost:3021`   | Allowed CORS origins              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | No       | `localhost:3021`   | Public frontend URL               |

---

## Production Checklist

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is strong and unique
- [ ] `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` changed from defaults
- [ ] `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` matches your public domain
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matches your public domain
- [ ] HTTPS enabled via Caddy or Cloudflare Tunnel
- [ ] Database port (`5433`) not exposed externally
- [ ] MinIO ports (`9010`, `9011`) not exposed externally
- [ ] `DEMO_USER_*` variables removed (not just commented)

---

## Known Limitations

- No team invitation UI (POST `/api/v1/orgs/:id/members` works via API)
- No role management UI (PATCH `/api/v1/orgs/:id/members` works via API)
- No board-level permissions UI (schema exists, not enforced)
- WebSocket horizontal scaling requires sticky sessions (single-instance only)

## Troubleshooting

### Container won't start

```bash
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs caddy
# Common: JWT_SECRET not set, DB not ready, port in use
```

### Database connection failed

```bash
docker compose ps postgres  # Check if running
docker compose logs postgres  # Check for errors
```

### "Invalid credentials"

- Register a new account at the login page
- Or set `DEMO_USER_*` env vars in `.env` for a seeded demo user
- Check startup logs: `docker compose logs backend | grep -i user`

### Build fails

```bash
docker compose down
docker system prune -f
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```
